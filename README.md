# ChatGPT Export Browser Bookmarklet

This browser bookmarklet enables you to export conversations with ChatGPT as markdown files. It uses the package `html-to-md` for converting HTML to markdown. The minified version is loaded dynamically. Including it in the built would result in too many characters to save as a bookmark in FireFox.
